txt2tags

ONE source, MULTI targets

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Welcome to the sources of the txt2tags site
%
% This is a live example of a marked up file in the txt2tags format.
% There are some special tricks you can learn by reading.
% As you may be wondering, lines starting with % are ignored.
%
% Txt2tags generates the HTML code for this text, and all the page
% formatting (colors, sizes, fonts, blocks, position) is made on an
% external CSS file (http://txt2tags.org/inc/site.css).
%
% See those first lines at the top? They are the page heading.
%
% Now comes some special configuration directives, starting with %!
%
% The config used by all pages are centralized on this file
% (http://txt2tags.org/inc/config.t2t) and the "includeconf"
% command reads it.
%
%!includeconf: inc/config.t2t

%%% Some post processing filter magic (search & replace)

% Adds an ID to the <body> tag
% Note: the (?i) makes the pattern case insensitive (avoids headaches)
%!postproc: '(?i)(<body)'	'\1 id="home"'
